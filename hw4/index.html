		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this project I simulated cloth with a mass-spring network and added visually convincing features like collisions with objects and self-collisions. 
		I then implemented different shader programs to give the cloth a wide variety of visual appearances based on lighting calculations and textures. 
		I thought it was a very interesting approach to use a hash map to reduce the number of collision checks, I could see myself applying an approach like this
		in my own research.

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<h3>Experimenting with simulation parameters for 2 pinned cloth</h3>
		<p>
			Adjusting the <b>stiffness</b> value to a low <code>ks</code> made the cloth very billowy and introduced finer ripples as the cloth settled to its
			resting position. In contrast, setting the stiffness to high value results in a single, parabolic crease between the pinned points and the vertical 
			creases at the bottom edge are not very prominent as the cloth swings into the vertical configuration. In the low stiffness case it takes longer for the
			constraint forces to propegate through the cloth as compared to the stiff cloth. This is consistent with the fact that waves propegate faster through stiffer materials 
			(this is why the speed of sound is faster in water than in air.)

		<p>
			When setting the <b>density</b> very high, the cloth bounces more in its swing because the springs are being extended more and the 
			default damping is not high enough to arrest the oscillatory motion. As expected, the denser cloth also hangs lower than the default parameter.

			When setting <b>damping</b> very low, down to 5%, the cloth behaves almost like a liquid, where many small ripples appear and sustain 
			their height for a number of seconds as the cloth settles to steady state. Additionally, the cloth swings much further past its vertical than with the nominal damping setting.
			In contrast, with high damping any ripples that appear as the cloth fall dissapear quickly and the cloth settles to its resting position without swinging past the vertical.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<h3>Implementation of collisions with spheres and planes</h3>
		<p>
			To implement collisions between point masses and spheres, I implemented the <code>collide()</code> method which is called 
			on a sphere object with a point mass as the argument. First I compute the vector pointing from the center of the sphere to 
			the position of the point mass, called \(r\), then if the squared length of this vector (computed by taking the dot product of the vector with itself)
			is less than the sphere's squared radius, the point mass is inside of the sphere. We avoid costly square-root computations by compared squared lengths.
			If the point mass is inside the sphere, we calculate the tangent point by adding the unit vector of \(r\) scaled by the sphere's radius \(R\) to the sphere's origin.
			The correction vector is given by the tangent point minus the point mass's current position. The mass's position gets updated to be its old position plus the update
			scaled by the friction factor. This method is called on every collision object for every point mass in <code>simulate()</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The collision method for masses and planes is structured similarly, and begins by computing the vectors between the point on the plane \(p^{'}\) and the 
			mass's last and current positions, \(u\) and \(u^{'}\). If \(u\) or \(u^{'}\) has a positive dot product (called \(a\) and \(b\) respectively) with the plane normal, then the vector is 
			'outside' the plane, and vise versa if the dot product is negative. If this dot product changes signs between the last and current positions, 
			then the mass has crossed over the surface. We calculate the tangent point knowing that the magnitude of \(b\) represents the normal distance between the mass's 
			position and the surface. The correction vector is then the vector between the last point and the target point, which is the tangent point plus a small surface offset
			in the direction of the side that the mass was originally on. This correction factor is added onto the last position scaled by the friction factor. This method 
			is similarly called on every collision object for every point mass.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<h3>Implementation of self-collisions</h3>
		<p>
			To handle self-collisions, for each step of the simulation, I generate a spatial hash map which associates a list of (pointers to) point masses with
			a 3D grid cell location. Grid cells are identified by unique keys based on the coordinates of their origin. To generate the map,
			I loop through all point masses, and use <code>hash_position()</code> to find the grid cell a point mass lies in and the associated key,
			then use that key to find the list associated with the cell, creating the list if it doesn't already exist, then finally appending the point mass to it.
		</p>
		<p>
			In <code>hash_position()</code>, for a given point mass, I find the nearest 
			grid cell origin by taking the modulo of the mass's \(x,y,z\) position components with \(w,h,t\), the dimensions of a single grid cell.
			Then I subtract this modulo expression from the \(x,y,z\) position, essentially "flooring" its position to the nearest grid cell origin.
			I then create a key associated with this origin position to uniquely identify each grid cell as explained above. 	
		</p>
		<p>
			With the hash map generated, during each simulation step I call <code>self_collide()</code> on every point mass. This method finds the key for
			the current point mass's position with <code>hash_position</code>, then retrieves the vector corresponding to its grid cell from <code>map</code>. Iterating through all the point mass
			pointers in this vector, I compute if the squared distance between the point mass and another candidate point mass is less than the threshold squared, \(4*thickness^2\).
			If it is, I compute the length by taking the square root of the length squared, which is only done if we need to make a correction since it is an expensive computation.
			I then append \(L - (2*thickness)\) times the unit vector pointing from the point pass to the collision candidate to the correction vector, which moves the pointmass away from the candidate
			by the distance needed to separate the pair by \(2*thickness\). After looping through all the candidates, if the number of corrections required is greater than zero,
			I update the position of the point mass by the averaged correction vector scaled down by the number of simulation steps.
		</p>
		<p><b>Note: Since I am unfamiliar with C++, I explained my desired hash map code in plain english to an LLM so I could learn the corresponding C++ syntax.</b></p>

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<h3>Shader programs</h3>
		<p>
			A shader program consists of two parts, a vertex shader and a fragment shader. A shader modifies verticies
			and fragments to render them with the desired color and lighting derived from the scene. Data can either come from vertices or from globally
			defined values declared as uniform variables (uniform accross all vertices/fragments). A vertex shader takes in data 
			of the given vertex as input, such as its position, normal vector, and corresponding texture coordinate, which are read-only. 
			This data may be used to compute output vertex data, such as in displacment mapping, which is then passed to the fragment shader.
		</p>
		<p>
			The fragment shader sets the color of the fragment based on scene lighting or from a texture. It takes in vertex data, such as the data 
			of the three vertices belonging to a triangle and uses these values to compute the color of this fragment when rasterized on the display.
			A shader program can use vertex data to compute different lighting models and emulate texture by manipulating normal vectors to change the amount of
			light reflected to the camera.
		</p>
		<h3>Blinn-Phong</h3>
		<p>
			The Blinn-Phong shading model approximates photo-realistic lighting by shading with a combination of ambient, diffuse, and specular 
			shading, each weighted by a differnt constant which can be used to tune the balance of each shading type. Ambient light is a baseline level of 
			light, irrespective of sources in the scene, which behaves like a small emissivity from the shaded fragment. Diffuse lighting gives objects a matte
			appearance by assuming light from sources is reflected by objects uniformly. The intensity of diffuse lighting is dependent on the angle of the incoming light with respect to the normal,
			where the more 'square' the light is with the surface, the greater the intensity. Specular shading contributes highlights to the lighting, and 
			is dependent on the viewing direction. Specular shading is very intense if the camera is looking near the mirror reflection direction, which is symmetric about the normal to the direction between the surface and source.
			Specular shading can be tuned in terms of intensity and "tightness" of the reflection lobe.

		</figure>

		<p>
			Bump mapping is easy to implement and provides a good visual result at a distance, appearing nearly identical to displacement mapping.
			Displacement mapping is closer to physical reality, but adds computational cost to the vertex shader program. The differences are visible when you zoom in 
			on the surface of the sphere at a shallow glancing angle. The edge is smooth with bump mapping since the actual geometry is not altered, whereas this edge is 
			made bumpy with displament mapping. This difference is not noticeable with a coarse geometry mesh because the vertices are spread too far apart to notice the differences in their position.
			For a high resolution mesh this difference is noticeable and makes the displacement mapped sphere appear much more realistic. Displacement mapping would be worth it for highly textured objects
			which the viewer will see up-close in the scene, such as rock faces, asteroids flying towards the player, etc.
